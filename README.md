📦 Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/duo-studio-clone.git
cd duo-studio-clone
Add the ppmori.ttf font to your root directory (same level as index.html).

Open index.html in your browser directly or via a local server.

✅ Recommended: Use Live Server in VS Code for smooth scrolling support with Locomotive Scroll.

📸 Screenshots
(Optional - add screenshots of different sections like page1, page2, and cursor effect)

💡 Notes
Make sure all image and video links are active; if not, replace with your own CDN or local assets.

Locomotive Scroll may require a fixed container with the class .main to enable smooth scroll effects.

The project uses mix-blend-mode: difference for cursor contrast – ensure your background supports this styling.
